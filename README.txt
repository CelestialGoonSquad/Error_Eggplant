		ERROR EGGPLANT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION


Purpose:

	Hello there, the ErrorEggplant is currently still being cultivated
	So, nothing works yet...nothing. The intention of tool is to calculate
	the error propagation for a set of data. We will start with providing
	this ability for Gaussian Distributions, but this will be extended to
	Poisson, Binomial, and other distributions. This tool is intended to
	work in conjunction with the PlottingPotato, with more vegetable tools
	to come in the future.

Expected Date of Completion --- February 2016
